        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Youtube</a></h3>

For the powerusers however, it's the real tools of youtube that shine. The spacebar-scroll-halfway-down-the-screen instead of pausing is a brilliant streak. Youtube best showcases it's ability to show you videos when you're trying to find videos you haven't seen yet by specific artists: It knows you'd rather
        re-watch the same video over and over.</p>
